**Introduction:** <br>
The client, the non-profit organization Paralyzed Veterans of America, pretends to have a better understanding of their donor’s behaviors by identifying different segments within their database through a customer segmentation. <br>
A dataset with a sample of the results of one of their last fundraising appeals, containing 95 412 donors, was given to us, in order to define, describe and explain the resulting clusters from its analysis, briefly explaining some recommended marketing approaches. For this effect, a CRISP-DM approach was used. <br>
The project can be accessed on our GitHub repository, which contains the Jupyter Notebook with all the relevant analysis and references.
